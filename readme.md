Welcome to Run The Ropes, a wrestling database made for new and experienced wrestling fans alike! My goal is to make a readable site for people to see and learn all about wrestlers and professional wrestling in general! There are a lot of features I want to add in the future so please keep a look out for those.


1. The user can see a list of wrestlers.
2. The user can click on a wrestler to see more information on that wrestler such as their debut date, birthday, stats, etc.
3. The user can add a wrestler to the website.
4. The user can delete a wrestler.
5. The user can update a wrestler's information.
6. The user can leave, update and delete comments on an individual wrestler's page.

When entering a new wrestler into the database, you can must enter a name. Everything else is optional as some wrestlers may not have every piece of information online. The weight and height categories are numerical inputs ONLY.

When leaving a comment, ratings go from 0 to 10 and are a numerical input ONLY. You also cannot leave any fields blank when leaving a comment. Everything must be filled in.

That's all for now! Lace up your boots and enjoy the app!
